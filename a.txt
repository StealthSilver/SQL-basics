MySQL -> Database
SQL -> language to communicate with the Database

Database is a collection of data in a format that can be easily accessed 

why db ?
1. can store large data 
2. features like security, scalability
3. easier to insert, update or delete data 

DBMS -> database management system is a layer over the data which organizes the data 

SQL DB v/s NoSQL DB

SQL : relational db (data is stored in tables)

e.g. MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL etc. 

NoSQL : non relational DB (data stored in document / key - val / graph etc.)
e.g. MongoDB , Cassandra, Neo$j etc. 

SQL -> structured query language 

SQL is a programming language used to interact with the relational databases 

the database can contain numerous tables 
these tables are interrelated 

the schema is the design of the table, they are captured by the columns 
rows in SQL is called tuple, they capture the data for respective id 

SQL commands 
these are the basic commands for SQL

CREATE DATABASE db_name ;
DROP DATABASE db_name ;
USE db_name;

SQL is case insensitive

to use the db -> USE 
to create tables :

CREATE table table_name (
    column_name1 datatype constrain
    column_name2 datatype constrain
    column_name3 datatype constrain
    column_name4 datatype constrain)

CREATE DATABASE db_name 
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db_name 

DROP DATABASE db_name 
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS db_name 

SHOW DATABASES
SHOW TABLES 

DATA TYPES

CONSTRAINTS 
rules for the data in the table

UNIQUE -> all values in column are different
DEFAULT -> sets the default value of the column 
CHECK -> it can limit the values allowed in the column
